# How to Use DIN

**DIN** is a decentralized federated learning protocol that integrates with **EVM-compatible blockchain ecosystems**. It allows you to securely train AI models and manage data in a sovereign, privacy-preserving manner. Here‚Äôs how you can use it:

---

### For Blockchain Ecosystem Managers

As a manager of a blockchain ecosystem, you can quickly integrate DIN to enable decentralized AI collaboration:

- **Integrate Federated Learning**: Add DIN‚Äôs protocol to support federated learning within your blockchain ecosystem.
- **Enable Data Sovereignty**: Ensure that data never leaves the owner‚Äôs control while still participating in AI training.

**Get Started**:  
1. Integrate DIN via smart contracts.
2. Reward participants for their contributions using stablecoins.

---

### For AI Developers

DIN lets AI developers securely train models on distributed datasets, with full control over data privacy.

- **Privacy-Preserving AI**: Train models without transferring or exposing data.
- **Decentralized Training**: Collaborate with others without compromising data sovereignty.

**Get Started**:  
1. Use DIN‚Äôs infrastructure to securely train your AI models.
2. Integrate rewards for data contributions.

---

### For Data Owners

Maintain full control over your data while participating in federated learning and receiving rewards.

- **Data Ownership**: Never give up control of your data.
- **Earn Rewards**: Get paid in stablecoins for your data contributions.

**Get Started**:  
1. Choose how and when your data is used.
2. Participate in model training securely.

### Example Use Case: Healthcare Ecosystem

Imagine a healthcare system where personal health data stays within personal data stores (PDSs) but still contributes to decentralized AI training. Participants are rewarded with stablecoins.
