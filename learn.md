# Learn About DIN

**DIN** is a **peer-to-peer federated learning (FL) blockchain protocol** that serves as **infrastructure for EVM-compatible blockchain ecosystems**. It powers **open-AI ecosystems** and **sovereign data collaboration** by enabling secure coordination across distributed data sources — without ever moving or exposing the data itself.

Built to seamlessly integrate with **EVM-compatible blockchain ecosystems**, DIN allows decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts to tap into federated learning capabilities, enabling secure, transparent, and fair AI collaboration directly on the blockchain. Whether you're training models, contributing data, or building decentralized applications, DIN provides the foundational infrastructure to ensure **data sovereignty** and secure participation — while keeping control where it belongs: with the data owner.

### Why It Matters

In today’s centralized systems, data often has to be pooled, transferred, or handed over to third parties. This breaks trust and compromises privacy. DIN flips the model:

- 🔐 **Sovereign Data**: Data owners maintain full control of their assets at all times.
- 🤝 **True Peer-to-Peer Collaboration**: No central servers, no gatekeepers — just direct, secure interaction.
- 💸 **Built-in Monetization**: Contributors are rewarded with **stablecoins** for participation — no intermediaries required.

By decentralizing access and rewards, DIN opens the door to **global collaboration without compromising privacy or ownership**.

### How It Works

> **DIN connects AI developers and data owners in a decentralized, trustless network.**

#### 🧠 For AI Developers
- Train models directly on data **where it lives** — no transfers, no exposure.
- Access diverse, high-quality datasets securely through the protocol.
- Receive model updates and evaluations **on-chain or through secure enclaves**.

#### 🗂️ For Data Owners
- Maintain full control of your data, never uploading it or handing it over.
- Choose when and how your data is used, with clear auditability.
- Earn **stablecoin rewards** for enabling model training on your data.

#### ⚙️ Visual Overview

### Key Differentiators

What sets DIN apart from other AI infrastructure projects?

- **No Data Movement**: Data remains local and sovereign — not even temporarily transferred.
- **Fully Decentralized Protocol**: No central hubs or federated managers; coordination is on-chain and P2P.
- **Fair, Transparent Rewards**: Built-in incentives using stablecoins — aligned with actual contributions.
- **Composable Infrastructure**: Open architecture for integration into other decentralized systems or apps.
- **Privacy by Design**: Cryptographic guarantees like **secure aggregation** and **privacy preservation** for data-regulation compliance.
