# Build with DIN

**DIN** is an open-source protocol that allows you to **build** decentralized applications (dApps), integrate federated learning, and customize the system. Hereâ€™s how you can get involved:

---

### For Blockchain Developers

DIN offers a range of features for blockchain developers to integrate federated learning into their ecosystems:

- **Build Decentralized AI**: Implement federated learning models directly in your blockchain network.
- **Custom Integrations**: Add your own features or customize DIN to meet specific needs.

**Get Started**:  
1. Fork the [DIN GitHub repo](https://github.com/DIN).
2. Build smart contracts that manage federated learning tasks and rewards.

---

### For AI Developers

DIN lets AI developers **build** decentralized models and train them on distributed data, preserving privacy.

- **Create Custom Models**: Extend the federated learning protocol with your own algorithms.
- **Model Contributions**: Integrate rewards for participants and track model updates.

**Get Started**:  
1. Learn how to extend DINâ€™s federated learning protocols for your AI models.
2. Develop new models that interact with decentralized datasets.

---

### For Contributors

Help enhance DIN by contributing to its open-source codebase. Whether itâ€™s fixing bugs, adding features, or improving documentation, your contributions make a difference.

- **Submit Code**: Fork the repo and submit pull requests.
- **Report Issues**: Contribute by identifying and reporting bugs.

**Get Started**:  
1. Check out the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/DIN/contribute).
2. Start building new features or fixing issues in the repo.
