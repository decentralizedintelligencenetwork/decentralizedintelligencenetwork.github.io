# Research & Collaboration

Doctelligence was born from rigorous academic research, starting in the **Oxford Computer Science Department** and later presented at **UC Berkeley’s Research in Decentralized Intelligence (RDI)**. We’re committed to advancing decentralized AI, federated learning, and data sovereignty through deep, interdisciplinary research. Our vision is to work collaboratively with academic communities, research institutions, and industry leaders to tackle the complex challenges of privacy, data sharing, and scalable AI systems.

## Our Research Journey

Our journey began in the **Oxford Computer Science Department**, where we explored novel ways to decentralize AI learning and preserve data sovereignty. Building on this foundation, we presented our **white paper (v1)** at **UC Berkeley’s RDI**, showcasing the potential for decentralized federated learning and the integration of blockchain technology to create privacy-preserving AI ecosystems.

### Key Research Areas:
- **Decentralized Federated Learning**: Exploring methods for secure, scalable machine learning where data remains distributed across participants without compromising privacy.
- **Data Sovereignty**: Ensuring that individuals maintain full control over their data in a decentralized context, supported by secure encryption techniques.
- **Blockchain for AI**: Leveraging blockchain technology to create transparent, immutable systems that facilitate decentralized collaboration between AI developers and data owners.
- **Privacy-Preserving Techniques**: Integrating cutting-edge cryptographic methods such as homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computation (MPC), and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to ensure data privacy while enabling collaboration.
